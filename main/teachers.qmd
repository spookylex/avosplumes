What are we trying to do when we teach writing?\
How do we create good assignments?\
How can we respond effectively to student writing?\
How can we make class time lively and worthwhile?

**Resources** (at left): the long view of teaching. Articles, handouts, take-home student materials.

**Classroom Activities** (below): the short view, for today's class, any method. In-class writing activities, oral activities to practice grammar.

**Videos** (at left): for "flipping" your French writing class. Place the videos on your site so students can use them for review and practice with the grammar exercises outside of class. Frees up time in class to work on writing and editing.

[**Grammar practice exercises**](http://avosplumes.org/students/ ""For Students""): the homework section. Replaces a grammar workbook. Interactive written homework exercises for your students. Answers, feedback.
